# Sensitivity labels in Office apps

This article describes:

- Requirements for your environment before you apply sensitivity labels to email, files, and attachments.
- Which sensitivity label capabilities are supported by each Office app.
- What happens when you combine sensitivity labels with other Microsoft security and compliance technologies that work with Office apps.
- How people in your organization can use sensitivity labels when they work with Office apps for Windows and Office apps for the web.
- Additional resources to help people in your organization start to use sensitivity labels.

## Subscription and licensing requirements for sensitivity labels

Users must have at least one of the following licenses assigned:

- [Microsoft 365 E3](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-all-microsoft-365-plans) or above

- [Office 365 E3](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/office-365-enterprise-e3-business-software) or above

- [Azure Information Protection Premium P1](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection/) or above

The Office built-in labeling client supports sensitivity labels with a subscription edition of Office. This labeling client doesn't support standalone editions of Office, such as Office 2016 or Office 2019. To use sensitivity labels with these editions of Office on Windows computers, install the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client.

To use automatic or recommended sensitivity labeling, your users need one of the following licenses:

- [Microsoft 365 E5](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-all-microsoft-365-plans) or above

- [Office 365 E5](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/office-365-enterprise-e5-business-software) or above

- [Azure Information Protection Premium P2](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection/)

## Support for sensitivity label capabilities in apps

For each capability, the following tables list the minimum version you need for that app to support sensitivity labels using built-in labeling. Or, if the label capability is in public preview or under review for a future release.

New versions of the apps are made available at different times for different update channels. For more information, including how to configure your update channel so that you can test a new labeling capability that you're interested in, see [Overview of update channels for Office 365 ProPlus](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/overview-of-update-channels-for-office-365-proplus). New capabilities that are in private preview are not included in the table but you might be able to join these previews by nominating your organization for the [Microsoft Information Protection private preview program](https://aka.ms/mip-preview).

Additional capabilities are available when you install the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client, which runs on Windows computers only. For these details, see [Compare the labeling clients for Windows computers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/rms-client/use-client#compare-the-labeling-clients-for-windows-computers).

## About the Office built-in labeling client

The Office built-in labeling client downloads sensitivity labels and sensitivity label policy settings from the following admin centers:

- Microsoft 365 compliance center
- Microsoft 365 security center
- Office 365 Security & Compliance Center

To use the Office built-in labeling client, you must have one or more [label policies published](create-sensitivity-labels.md#publish-sensitivity-labels-by-creating-a-label-policy) to users from one of the listed admin centers.

However, if users have one of the Azure Information Protection clients installed ([unified labeling client](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/rms-client/aip-clientv2) or [classic client](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/rms-client/aip-client)), by default, the built-in labeling client is turned off in their Office apps. To use built-in labeling rather than the Azure Information Protection client for Office apps, disable or uninstall the Office add-in for Azure Information Protection:

1. Complete one of these options:
    
    - **For multiple computers:** Configure the **Use the Sensitivity feature in Office to apply and view sensitivity labels** Group Policy setting. Find this setting under **User Configuration/Administrative Templates/Microsoft Office 2016/Security Settings**. Deploy this setting through group policy, or by using the [Office cloud policy service](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/overview-office-cloud-policy-service).
    
    - **For a single computer:** See "View, manage, and install add-ins in Office programs" for information about how to  [permanently disable or remove](https://support.office.com/article/16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d) the Azure Information Protection add-in on a single computer.

2. Restart all Office applications.

When you disable or uninstall this Office add-in, the Azure Information Protection client remains installed so that you can continue to label files outside your Office apps. For example, by using File Explorer, or PowerShell.

For information about which features are supported by the Azure Information Protection clients and the Office built-in labeling client, see [Choose which labeling client to use for Windows computers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/rms-client/use-client#choose-which-labeling-client-to-use-for-windows-computers) from the Azure Information Protection documentation.

## Protection templates and sensitivity labels

Administrator-defined [protection templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/configure-policy-templates), such as those you define for Office 365 Message Encryption, aren't visible in Office apps when you're using built-in labeling. This simplified experience reflects that there's no need to select a protection template, because the same settings are included with sensitivity labels that have encryption enabled.

If you need to convert existing protection templates to labels, use the Azure portal and the following instructions: [To convert templates to labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/configure-policy-templates#to-convert-templates-to-labels).

## Apply sensitivity labels to files, emails, and attachments

Users can apply just one label at a time for each document or email.

When you label an email message that has attachments, the attachments don't inherit the label. If the attachments had a label they keep that separately applied label. If the attachments didn't have a label, then the attachments remain without a label. However, if the label for the email applies protection, that protection is applied to Office attachments.

## Sensitivity label compatibility

**With RMS-enlightened apps**. If you open a labeled _and encrypted_ document or email in an [RMS-enlightened application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/requirements-applications#rms-enlightened-applications) that doesn't support sensitivity labels, the app still enforces encryption and rights management.

**With Azure Information Protection client**. You can view and change sensitivity labels that you apply to documents and emails with the Office built-in labeling client with the Azure Information Protection client, and the other way around.

**With other versions of Office**. Any authorized user can open labeled documents and emails in other versions of Office. However, you can only view or change the label in supported Office versions or in the Azure Information Protection client. Supported Office app versions are listed in the tables in this article.

## Support for SharePoint and OneDrive files protected by sensitivity labels

To use the Office built-in labeling client in Office on the web, the document must be located in a OneDrive for Business or SharePoint Online instance that has opted-in to the [Enable sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive](sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files.md).

## When Office 365 applies content marking and encryption to content

Office 365 applies content marking and encryption with a sensitivity label differently, depending on the app you use.

| App | Content marking | Encryption |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Word, Excel, PowerPoint on all platforms | Immediately | Immediately |
| Outlook for PC and Mac | After Exchange Online sends the email | Immediately |
| Outlook on the web, iOS, and Android | After Exchange Online sends the email | After Exchange Online sends the email |
|
