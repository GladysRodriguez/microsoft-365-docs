# Create and configure sensitivity labels and their policies

To create and publish your [sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md), go to your labeling admin center, such as the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/). You can also use the Microsoft 365 security center, or the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center.

First, create and configure the sensitivity labels that you want to make available in Office apps and for services. Then, create one or more label policies that contain the labels and policy settings that you configure. It's the label policy that publishes the labels and settings for your chosen users and locations.

## Permissions required to create and manage sensitivity labels

Members of your compliance team who will create sensitivity labels need permissions to the Microsoft 365 compliance center, Microsoft 365 security center, or Office 365 Security & Compliance Center. 

By default, your tenant admin has access to these admin centers and can give compliance officers and other people access, without giving them all of the permissions of a tenant admin. For this delegated limited admin access, go to the **Permissions** page of one of these admin centers, and then add members to the **Compliance Data Administrator**, **Compliance Administrator** or **Security Administrator** role group.

For instructions, see [Give users access to the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/grant-access-to-the-security-and-compliance-center).

These permissions are required only to create and configure sensitivity labels and their label policies. They are not required to apply the labels in apps or services.

## Create and configure sensitivity labels

1. In your labeling admin center, navigate to sensitivity labels:
    
    - Microsoft 365 compliance center: 
        - **Solutions** > **Information protection**
        
        If you don't immediately see this option, first select **Show all**. 
    
    - Microsoft 365 security center: 
        - **Classification** > **Sensitivity labels**
    
    - Office 365 Security & Compliance Center:
        - **Classification** > **Sensitivity labels**

2. On the **Labels** tab, select **+ Create a label** to start the **New sensitivity label** wizard.

3. Follow the prompts for the label settings.
    
    For more information about the label settings, see [What sensitivity labels can do](sensitivity-labels.md#what-sensitivity-labels-can-do) from the overview information.

4. Repeat these steps to create more labels. However, if you want to create a sublabel, first select the parent label and select **...** for **More actions**, and then select **Add sub label**.

5. When you have created all the labels you need, review their order and if necessary, move them up or down. To change the order of a label, select **...** for **More actions**, and then select **Move up** or **Move down**. For more information, see [Label priority (order matters)](sensitivity-labels.md#label-priority-order-matters) from the overview information.

To edit an existing label, select it, and then select **Edit label**. This starts the **Edit sensitivity label** wizard, which lets you change all the label settings in step 3. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you edit a label that's already published by using a label policy, no extra steps are needed when you finish the wizard. For example, you don't need to add it to a new label policy for the changes to become available to the same users. However, allow up to 24 hours for the changes to replicate to users and services.

Until you publish your labels, they won't be available to select in apps or for services. To publish the labels, they must be [added to a label policy](#publish-sensitivity-labels-by-creating-a-label-policy).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On this **Labels** tab, do not select the **Publish labels** tab (or the **Publish label** button when you edit a label) unless you need to create a new label policy. You need multiple label policies only if users need different labels or different policy settings. Aim to have as few label policies as possible — it's not uncommon to have just one label policy for the organization.

### Additional label settings with Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell

Additional label settings are available with the [Set-Label](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance/set-label?view=exchange-ps) cmdlet from [Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/office-365-scc/office-365-scc-powershell?view=exchange-ps).

Use the *LocaleSettings* parameter for multinational deployments so that users see the label name and tooltip in their local language. See the following section for an example configuration. 

Using this cmdlet, you can also specify [advanced settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-customizations) for the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client. These advanced settings include setting a label color, and applying a custom property when a label is applied. For the full list, see [Available advanced settings for label policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-customizations#available-advanced-settings-for-label-policies). 

#### Example configuration to configure a sensitivity label for different languages

The following example shows the PowerShell configuration for a label named "Public" with placeholder text for the tooltip. In this example, the label name and tooltip text is configured for French, Italian, and German.

As a result of this configuration, users who have Office apps that use those display languages see their label names and tooltips in the same language. Similarly, if you have the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client installed to label files from File Explorer, users who have those language versions of Windows see their label names and tooltips in their local language when they use the right-click actions for labeling.

For the languages that you need to support, use the Office [language identifiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/office2016/language-identifiers-and-optionstate-id-values-in-office-2016#language-identifiers) (also known as language tags), and specify your own translation for the label name and tooltip.

Before you run the commands in PowerShell, you must first [connect to Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/office-365-scc/connect-to-scc-powershell/connect-to-scc-powershell?view=exchange-ps).


```powershell
$Languages = @("fr-fr","it-it","de-de")
$DisplayNames=@("Publique","Publico","Oeffentlich")
$Tooltips = @("Texte Français","Testo italiano","Deutscher text")
$label = "Public"
$DisplayNameLocaleSettings = [PSCustomObject]@{LocaleKey='DisplayName';
Settings=@(
@{key=$Languages[0];Value=$DisplayNames[0];}
@{key=$Languages[1];Value=$DisplayNames[1];}
@{key=$Languages[2];Value=$DisplayNames[2];})}
Set-Label -Identity $Label -LocaleSettings (ConvertTo-Json $DisplayNameLocaleSettings -Depth 3 -Compress)
$TooltipLocaleSettings = [PSCustomObject]@{LocaleKey='Tooltip';
Settings=@(
@{key=$Languages[0];Value=$Tooltips[0];}
@{key=$Languages[1];Value=$Tooltips[1];}
@{key=$Languages[2];Value=$Tooltips[2];})}
Set-Label -Identity $Label -LocaleSettings (ConvertTo-Json $TooltipLocaleSettings -Depth 3 -Compress)
```

## Publish sensitivity labels by creating a label policy

1. In your labeling admin center, navigate to sensitivity labels:
    
    - Microsoft 365 compliance center: 
        - **Solutions** > **Information protection**
        
        If you don't immediately see this option, first select **Show all**. 
    
    - Microsoft 365 security center: 
        - **Classification** > **Sensitivity labels**
    
    - Office 365 Security & Compliance Center:
        - **Classification** > **Sensitivity labels**

2. Select the **Label policies** tab.

3. Select **Publish labels** to start the **Create policy wizard**.

4. Select **Choose sensitivity labels to publish**. Select the labels that you want to make available in apps and to services, and then select **Add**.

5. Review the selected labels and to make any changes, select **Edit**. Otherwise, select **Next**.

6. Follow the prompts to configure the policy settings.
    
    For more information about the settings, see [What label policies can do](sensitivity-labels.md#what-label-policies-can-do) from the overview information.

7. Repeat these steps if you need different policy settings for different users or locations. For example, you want additional labels for a group of users, or a different default label for a subset of users.

8. If you create more than one label policy that might result in a conflict for a user or location, review the policy order and if necessary, move them up or down. To change the order of a label policy, select **...** for **More actions**, and then select **Move up** or **Move down**. For more information, see [Label policy priority (order matters)](sensitivity-labels.md#label-policy-priority-order-matters) from the overview information.

Completing the wizard automatically publishes the label policy. To make changes to a published policy, simply edit it. There is no specific publish or republish action for you to select.

To edit an existing label policy, select it, and then select **Edit Policy**. This starts the **Create policy** wizard, which lets you edit which labels are included and the label settings. When you complete the wizard, any changes are automatically replicated to the selected users and services.

Typically, users see the labels in their Office apps within a couple of hours. However, allow up to 24 hours for your label policies and any changes to them to replicate to all users and services.

### Additional label policy settings with Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell

Additional label policy settings are available with the [Set-Label](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance/set-label?view=exchange-ps) cmdlet from [Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/office-365-scc/office-365-scc-powershell?view=exchange-ps).

Using this cmdlet, you can specify [advanced settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-customizations) for the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client. These advanced settings include setting a different default label for Outlook, and implement pop-up messages in Outlook that warn, justify, or block emails being sent. For the full list, see [Available advanced settings for labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-customizations#available-advanced-settings-for-labels). 

You can also use this cmdlet to add and remove labels to and from a label policy.
