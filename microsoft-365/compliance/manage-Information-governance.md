# Manage information governance

 Manage your content lifecycle using Microsoft 365 features to import, store, and classify business-critical data so you can keep what you need and delete what you don't.

|**Capability**|**More information**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **Manage data** | Use the [import service](importing-pst-files-to-office-365.md) to quickly bulk-import PST files to Exchange Online mailboxes in your organization. <br> Configure [unlimited archiving](unlimited-archiving.md) to provide users with additional mailbox storage space. <br> Use [retention polices](retention-policies.md) to streamline administration about how your organization retains, deletes, or retains and then deletes content. |
| **Monitor data** | [Verify data labels](view-label-activity-for-documents.md) are correctly applied to content in your organization. <br> Use built-in [label analytics](label-analytics.md) to quickly see where labels are used most and where they are being applied.|
| **Manage inactive mailboxes** | Your organization might need to retain former employees' email after they leave the organization. Depending on your organization's retention requirements, you might need to retain mailbox content for a few months or years after employment ends, or you might need to retain mailbox content indefinitely. Regardless of how long you need to retain email, you can create [inactive mailboxes](inactive-mailboxes-in-office-365.md) in Office 365 to retain the mailbox of former employees.  |
| **Records management** | Ensure [core business records](records-management.md) are properly declared and stored immutability with full audit visibility to meet regulatory obligations. |
