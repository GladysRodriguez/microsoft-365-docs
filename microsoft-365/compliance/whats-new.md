### Get to know the new neighborhood

The new Microsoft 365 compliance center includes brand new solutions as well as the compliance features you know and love from the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center. Let’s dig in a bit more…

#### New compliance solutions

You might be wondering what a *solution* is. As much as the cloud has revolutionized the way business is done, it’s also opened the door for new methods of data theft and fraud and necessitated new regulations. Our compliance solutions are collections of integrated capabilities that can help you help you manage these evolving compliance requirements. A solution's capabilities might include a combination of policies, alerts, reports, and more.

Here’s a summary of the new solutions you’ll find. Keep an eye out for others coming soon.

> [!NOTE]
> These solutions are located only in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. They can’t be managed in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center.

## September 2019

Wondering why it's quiet on the release front this month? We're heads down building new, innovative compliance solutions that'll be unveiled at [Microsoft Ignite](https://www.microsoft.com/ignite) in November. Stay tuned!

### New encryption options for sensitivity labels 

When configuring encryption for a sensitivity label, you now have two options that lets users assign permissions when they manually apply the label to email and docs:<br>
- When applying the label to **Outlook email**, users can enforce restrictions equivalent to the Do Not Forward option. Recipients will be able to read the message but not forward, print, or copy the content.
- When applying the label to **Word, PowerPoint, and Excel files**, users will be prompted to assign access permissions to specific users and groups.

## August 2019

### Update to data investigations

When performing a data investigation, you can now delete items from their original locations. This means you can delete items from Exchange mailboxes, SharePoint sites, and OneDrive accounts across your organization. Because you collected the items as evidence, you’ll have copies of them retained in the evidence set to you can investigate further or just keep as a reference.

- **Compliance data admin**. Users with this role have permissions to protect and track data in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, Microsoft 365 admin center, and Azure. They can also manage everything the Exchange admin center, Compliance Manager, Teams & Skype for Business admin center and create support tickets for Azure and Microsoft 365.

### Search and filtering for reports
