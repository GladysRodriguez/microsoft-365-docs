# ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management Systems Standards

## ISO 9001 overview

ISO 9001:2015 is an international standard that establishes the criteria for a quality management system. It is the only standard in the ISO 9000 family that results in a formal certification. The standard is based on several quality management principles, including clear focus on meeting customer requirements, strong corporate governance and leadership commitment to quality objectives, process-driven approach to meeting objectives, and focus on continuous improvement. ISO 9001:2015 helps organizations improve customer satisfaction by focusing on the consistency and quality of products and services provided to customers.

## Microsoft and ISO 9001:2015

An independent third-party auditing firm performed a rigorous examination of Microsoft Azure and several Microsoft online services for adherence to the quality management principles established by ISO 9001:2015. The available third-party certification provides independent confirmation that Azure and covered Microsoft online services meet the ISO 9001:2015 requirements.
