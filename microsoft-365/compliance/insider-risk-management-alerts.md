# Insider risk management alerts (preview)

Insider risk management alerts are automatically generated by risk indicators defined in insider risk management policies. These alerts give compliance analysts and investigators an all-up view of the current risk status and allow your organization to triage and take actions for discovered risks.

## Alert dashboard

The insider risk **Alert dashboard** allows you to view and take action on alerts generated by insider risk policies. Each report widget displays information for last 30 days.

- **Alerts to review**: The total number of alerts needing review and triage are listed, including a breakdown by alert severity.
- **Open alerts over past 30 days**: The total number of alerts created by policy matches over the last 30 days, sorted by high, medium, and low alert severity levels.
- **Average time to resolved alerts**: A summary of useful alert statistics:
    - Average time to resolve high severity alerts, listed in hours, days, or months.
    - Average time to resolve medium severity alerts, listed in hours, days, or months.
    - Average time to resolve low severity alerts, listed in hours, days, or months.

## Alert status and severity

You can triage alerts into one of the following statuses:

- **Confirmed**: An alert confirmed and assigned to a new or existing case.
- **Dismissed**: An alert dismissed as benign in the triage process.
- **Needs review**: A new alert where triage actions have not yet been taken.
- **Resolved**: An alert that is part of a closed and resolved case.

Alert risk scores are automatically calculated from several risk activity attributes. These attributes include the type of risk activity, the number and frequency of the activity occurrence, the history of user risk activity, and the addition of activity risks that may boost the seriousness of the activity. The alert risk score drives the programmatic assignment of a risk severity level for each alert and cannot be customized. If alerts remain untriaged and risk activities continue to accrue to the alert, the risk severity level can increase. Risk analysts and investigators can use the alert risk severity to help triage alerts in accordance to your organization's risk policies and standards.

The alert risk severity levels are:

- **High severity**: The activity and indicators for the alert pose significant risk. The associated risk activities are serious, repetitive, and corelate strongly to other significant risk factors.
- **Medium severity**: The activity and indicators for the alert pose a moderate risk. The associated risk activities are moderate, frequent, and have some correlation to other risk factors.
- **Low severity**: The activity and indicators for the alert pose a minor risk. The associated risk activities are minor, more infrequent, and do not corelate to other significant risk factors.

## Filter alerts

Depending on the number and type of active insider risk management policies in your organization, reviewing a large queue of alerts can be challenging. Using alert filters can help analysts and investigators sort alerts by several attributes. To filter alerts on the alerts dashboard, select the **Filter** control. You can filter alerts by one or more attributes:

- **Status**: Select one or more status values to filter the alert list. The options are *Confirmed*, *Dismissed*, *Needs review*, and *Resolved*.
- **Severity**: Select one or more alert risk severity levels to filter the alert list. The options are *High*, *Medium*, and *Low*.
- **Time detected**: Select the start and end dates for when the alert was created.
- **Policy**: Select one or more policies to filter the alerts generated by the selected policies.

## Search alerts

To search the alert name for a specific word, select the **Search** control and type the word to search. The search results display any policy alert containing the word defined in the search.

## Triage alerts

To triage an insider risk alert, complete the following steps:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com), go to **Insider risk management** and select the **Alerts** tab.
2. On the **Alerts dashboard**, select the alert you want to triage.
3. On the **Alerts detail pane**, you can review the following tabs and triage the alert:
    - **Overview**: This tab contains general information about the alert and allows you to confirm the alert and create a new case, or allows you to dismiss the alert.
        - **Status**: The status of the alert
        - **Time detected**: The length of time since the alert was generated.
        - **Policy matches**: The policies that generated the alert are listed. Each policy is listed as a link to the policy details.
        - **Severity**: The current alert risk severity level, listed as *high*, *medium*, or *low*. The severity level may increase or decrease over time if the alert is not triaged.
        - **Case**: If confirmed, the case generated from the alert is listed. For new alerts, the Case field has a *None* value.
    - **User activity**: This tab displays the activity history for the user associated with the alert. This history includes other alerts and event activities related to risk indicators defined in the template assigned to the policy for this alert. This history allows risk analysts and investigators to factor in any past risky behavior for the employee as part of the triage process.
    - **User profile**: This tab displays the general information about the employee assigned to the alert.
    - **Confirm and create case**: Visible across all tabs, use this button to confirm and create a new case. This automatically changes the alert status to *Confirmed*.
    - **Dismiss**: Visible across all tabs, use this button to dismiss the alert. This changes the alert status to *Resolved*.

## Create a case for an alert

After an alert is reviewed and triaged, you can create a new case to further investigate the risk activity. To create a case for an alert, follow these steps:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com), go to **Insider risk management** and select the **Alerts** tab.
2. On the **Alerts dashboard**, select the alert you want to confirm and create a new case for.
3. On the **Alerts details pane**, select **Confirm and create case**.
4. On the **Confirm alert and create insider risk case** dialog, enter a name for the case, select users to add as contributors, and add comments as applicable. Comments are automatically added to the case as a case note.
5. Select **Create case** to create a new case or select **Cancel** to close the dialog without creating a case.
