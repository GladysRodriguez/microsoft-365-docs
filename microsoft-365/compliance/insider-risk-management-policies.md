# Insider risk management policies (preview)

Insider risk management policies determine which employees are in-scope and which types of risk indicators are configured for alerts. You can quickly create a policy that applies to all users in your organization, or define individual users or groups for management in a policy. Policies support content priorities to focus policy conditions on multiple or specific Microsoft Teams, SharePoint sites, data sensitivity types, and data labels. Using templates, they include specific risk indicators and how much weight they are assigned within a policy, effectively determining the weight of each alert trigger in the policy. Policies windows allow you to define the time frame to apply the policy to alert activities and are used to determine the duration of the policy once activated. The maximum policy limit is five active policies at the same time. However, you can configure additional policies and activate and deactivate policies as needed.

## Policy dashboard

The **Policy dashboard** allows you to quickly see the policies in your organization and the current status of alerts associated with each policy.

- **Policy name**: The name assigned to the policy in the policy wizard.
- **Active alerts**: The number of active alerts for each policy.
- **Confirmed alerts**: The total number of alerts the resulted in cases from the policy in the last 365 days.
- **Actions taken on alerts**: The total number of alerts that were confirmed or dismissed for the last 365 days.
- **Policy effectiveness**: The percentage determined by total confirmed alerts divided by total actions taken on alerts (which is the sum of alerts that were confirmed or dismissed over the past year).
- **Active**: The status of the case, either *Yes* or *No*.

## Policy templates

Insider risk management templates are pre-defined policy conditions that define the types of risk indicators monitored by a policy. Each policy must have a template assigned in the policy creation wizard before the policy is created. When you create a new insider risk policy, you'll choose from one of the following templates.

### Departing employee data theft

When employees leave your organization, there are specific risk indicators typically associated with data theft by departing employees. This policy template prioritizes these indicators and focuses detection and alerts to this risk area. Data theft for departing employees may include downloading files from SharePoint Online, copying files to portable devices such as USB drives, printing files, and copying data to personal cloud messaging and storage services near their employment resignation and end dates. This template prioritizes risk indicators relating to these activities and how they correlate with employee employment status.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>When using this template, you must configure a Microsoft 365 HR connector to periodically import resignation and termination date information for employees in your organization. See the [Import data with the HR Connector](import-hr-data.md) topic for step-by-step guidance to configure the Microsoft 365 HR Connector for your organization.

### Data leaks

Protecting data and preventing data leaks is a constant challenge for most organizations, particularly with the rapid grow of new data created by employees, devices, and services. Employees are empowered to create, store, and share information across services and devices that make managing data leaks increasingly more complex and difficult. Data leaks can include accidental oversharing of information outside your organization or data theft with malicious intent. This template prioritizes real-time detection of suspicious SharePoint Online data downloads, file and folder sharing, copying files to portable devices such as USB drives, printing files, and copying data to personal cloud messaging and storage services.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>When using this template, you must configure at least one Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy to define sensitive information in your organization. See the [Create, test, and tune a DLP policy](create-test-tune-dlp-policy.md) topic for step-by-step guidance to configure DLP policies for your organization.

### Offensive language in email

Detecting and taking action to prevent offensive and abusive behavior is a critical component of preventing risk. Built-in offensive language classifiers in Microsoft 365 can scan sent email messages from Exchange Online mailboxes in your organization for different types of compliance issues. These classifiers use a combination of artificial intelligence and keywords to identify language in email likely to violate anti-harassment policies. Use this template to quickly create a policy that uses these classifiers to automatically detect email message content that may be considered abusive or offensive. Insider risk management uses classifiers that scan sent email messages for English language terms and sentiment for offensive language.

## Monitoring windows

Policy monitoring windows allow you to define time periods that trigger policy activation based on events and activities for the insider risk management policy templates. Depending on the policy template you choose, the following monitoring windows are available:

- **In-scope timespan**: Available for all policy templates, the *In-scope timespan* is the defined number of days that the window activates **after** a triggering event. The window activates for 1 to 30 days after a triggering event occurs for any user assigned to the policy. For example, you've configured an insider risk management policy and set the *In-scope timespan* to 30 days. Several months have passed since you configured the policy and a triggering event occurs for one of the users included in the policy. The triggering event activates the *In-scope timespan* and the policy is active for that user for 30 days after the triggering event occurred.
- **Historic timespan**: Available for all policy templates, the *historic timespan* is the defined number of days that the window activates **before** a triggering event. The window activates for 0 to 180 days before a triggering event occurs for any user assigned to the policy. For example, you've configured an insider risk management policy and set the *Historic timespan* to 90 days. Several months have passed since you configured the policy and a triggering event occurs for one of the users included in the policy. The triggering event activates the *Historic timespan* and the policy gathers historic activities for that user for 90 days prior to the triggering event.
- **Future termination window**: You'll see this setting in the pubic preview, but it isn’t applied to any policies and will be removed for the production release of this solution.
- **Past termination window**: You'll see this setting in the pubic preview, but it isn’t applied to any policies and will be removed for the production release of this solution.

## Create a new policy

To create a new insider risk management policy, you'll use the policy wizard in **Insider risk management** solution in the Microsoft 365 compliance center.

Complete the following steps to create a new policy:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com), go to **Insider risk management** and select the **Policies** tab.
2. Select **Create policy** to open the policy wizard

    - **Choose policy template (required)**: Select one of the [policy templates](insider-risk-management-policies.md#policy-templates) to define the types of risk indicators are monitored by the policy.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >If you select the *Data leaks* template, you'll need to configure at least one DLP policy that you'll assign later in the wizard. If you select the *Departing employee data theft* template, you'll need to configure the HR Connector to use the full signal detection features of the policy template.

4. Select **Next** to continue.
5. On the **Users** page, select **Add user or group** to define which users are included in the policy or select **All users and mail-enabled groups** checkbox. Select **Next** to continue.
