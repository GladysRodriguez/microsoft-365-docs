# Manage self-service purchases (Admin)

As an admin, you can see self-service purchases made by people in your organization. You can see the product, purchaser name, subscriptions purchased, expiry date, purchase price, and assigned users for each self-service purchase. If required for your organization, you can turn off self-service purchasing on a per product basis via PowerShell. You have the same data management and access policies over products bought through self-service purchase or centrally.

You can also control whether users in your organization can make self-service purchases. For more information, see [Use AllowSelfServicePurchase for the MSCommerce PowerShell module](allowselfservicepurchase-powershell.md).

## View self-service subscriptions

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Products & services</a> page.

2. Next to **Refine results**, from the **Account type** drop-down, choose **Self-service**.

3. To view more details about a subscription, choose one from the list.

## View who has licenses for a self-service purchase subscription

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842264" target="_blank">Licenses</a> page.

2. Choose the filter icon, then choose **Self-service**.

3. Select a product to see licenses assigned to people.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If there are multiple purchases for a product, that product is only listed once, and the **Available quantity** column shows the total of all subscriptions bought for that product.

4. The **Users** list is grouped by the names of people who made self-service purchases.

5. To export a list of users with licenses for these subscriptions, choose the subscriptions that you want to export, then choose **Export users**.

## Disable or enable self-service purchases

You can disable or enable self-service purchases for users in your organization. The **MSCommerce** PowerShell module includes a **PolicyID** parameter value for **AllowSelfServicePurchase** that lets you control whether users in your organization can make self-service purchases, and for which products.

You can use the **MSCommerce** PowerShell module to:

- View the default state of the **AllowSelfServicePurchase** parameter value &mdash; whether it's enabled or disabled by product
- View a list of applicable products and whether self-service purchase is enabled or disabled
- View or modify the current setting for a specific product to either enable or disable it

For more information, see [Use AllowSelfServicePurchase for the MSCommerce PowerShell module](allowselfservicepurchase-powershell.md).

## Centralize licenses under a single subscription

You can assign existing licenses or purchase additional subscriptions through existing agreements for users assigned to self-service purchases. After you assign these centrally purchased licenses, you can request that purchasers cancel their existing subscriptions.

1. Sign in to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">admin center</a> with your Global admin or Billing admin account.

2. Go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433" target="_blank">Purchase services</a> page.

3. Find and choose the product that you want to buy, then choose **Buy**.

4. Complete the remaining steps to complete your purchase.

5. Follow the steps in [View who has licenses for a self-service purchased subscription](#view-who-has-licenses-for-a-self-service-purchase-subscription) to export a list of users to reference in step 6.

6. Assign licenses to everyone who has a license in the other subscription. For full steps, see [Assign licenses to users](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/subscriptions-and-billing/assign-licenses-to-users).

7. Contact the person who bought the self-service purchase subscription and ask them to cancel it.
