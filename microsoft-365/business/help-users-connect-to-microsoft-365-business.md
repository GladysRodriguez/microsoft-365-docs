# Help users connect to Microsoft 365 Business

After you complete setup, your default device policies are in place and ready to apply. On mobile devices, users download Office apps. Policies are then applied when the user signs in with their work or school account. There's a bit more work to do before policies apply to Windows PCs, such as an in-place upgrade. See and share the following topics to help users get set up and connected:
  
[Set up Windows devices for Microsoft 365 Business users](set-up-windows-devices.md)
  
[Use the step-by-step guide to add Autopilot devices and profile](add-autopilot-devices-and-profile.md)
