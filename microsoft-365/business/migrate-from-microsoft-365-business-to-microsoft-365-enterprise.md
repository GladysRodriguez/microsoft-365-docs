# Migrate from Microsoft 365 Business to Microsoft 365 E3

Microsoft 365 Business has everything you need for your small business, combining the best-in-class cloud-based productivity apps with simple device management and security that enable your employees to do their best work. In some cases, however, you may need to migrate your Microsoft 365 Business subscription to Microsoft 365 E3. 

For example, your business has grown and needs more than 300 licenses (congratulations, by the way).

Or, your business needs enterprise features, such as Office 365 ProPlus, Windows 10 Enterprise E3, or Enterprise Client Access Licenses (CALs).

Upgrading is easy: you can start the upgrade [from the Admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/subscriptions-and-billing/upgrade-to-different-plan?view=o365-worldwide). All your data and configuration in your current subscription is maintained. There's nothing for you to do to prepare for the migration and nothing to do afterward, except take advantage of the new features. 

>[!Note]
>You can also use a Microsoft 365 Business subscription for up to 300 seats and get a Microsoft 365 E3 subscription for more than 300 seats. However, Office 365 ATP is not included with Microsoft 365 E3. For continued threat protection, you should add additional Office 365 ATP licenses so that all of the users in scope of your Office 365 ATP polices are licensed.

\* Users who have been assigned access to SaaS apps can get SSO access to up to 10 apps. Admins can configure SSO and change user access to different SaaS apps, but SSO access is only allowed for 10 apps per user at a time. All Office 365 apps are counted as a single app.

## Migration

To migrate, work with your partner to move your Microsoft 365 Business subscription and licenses to a suitable Microsoft 365 E3 subscription with its licenses.

The following sections describe what changes you need to make, if any, and what you can do after the migration.

### Microsoft 365 subscription configuration and data

You don’t need to make any changes to your current subscription or data before migrating, which includes:

- Subscription configuration, such as DNS domain names.
- User and group accounts and authentication settings, such as multi factor authentication or conditional access policies.
- Productivity service configurations and their data, such as Teams, Exchange Online mailboxes, SharePoint Online sites, OneDrive for Business folders, and OneNote notebooks.

Your users can now enjoy unlimited storage in the Exchange Online mailboxes and OneDrive for Business folders.

You can begin using Cloud App Discovery, Azure AD Connect Health, and SSO for more than 10 apps.

>[!Note]
>Users migrated to Microsoft 365 E3 can no longer use Outlook Customer Manager and MileIQ.

### Device management with Intune

You don’t need to make any changes to your current Intune configuration before migrating, which includes enrolled devices and device and app settings.

### Windows 10

Microsoft 365 Business includes Windows 10 Business, which you can install with Windows AutoPilot. When you migrate to Microsoft 365 E3, each user license includes Windows 10 Enterprise E3, which you can also install with Windows Autopilot.
