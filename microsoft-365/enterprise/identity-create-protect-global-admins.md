# Step 1: Create and protect your global admin accounts

## Protect global administrator accounts

*This is required and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

In this section, you'll help prevent digital attacks on your organization by ensuring that your administrator accounts are as secure as possible. To do this, you must:

- Create more than one dedicated global administrator accounts with [strong passwords](https://support.microsoft.com//help/4026406/microsoft-account-create-a-strong-password) and use them only when necessary.
- Perform day-to-day administration by assigning specific administrator roles—such as Exchange administrator or Password administrator—to other dedicated accounts for those roles or user accounts of IT staff as needed.

For your dedicated global admin accounts, you must also:

1. Test per-user account or Conditional Access-based Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) settings on a test user account to ensure that MFA works correctly and predictably. MFA requires a secondary form of authentication, such as a verification code sent to a smart phone.
2. Create and enable a Conditional Access policy for your global administrator accounts that requires MFA and uses the strongest form of secondary authentication available in your organization. See [Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](identity-access-prerequisites.md#protecting-administrator-accounts) for more information.

See [Protect your Office 365 global administrator accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/protect-your-global-administrator-accounts#additional-protections-for-enterprise-organizations) for additional protections.

> [!Note]
> Emergency accounts for break-glass scenarios in emergencies such as a cyberattack should be cloud-only accounts. You may also have global administrator accounts (eligible or permanent) that are not cloud-only. For more information, see [Manage emergency-access administrative accounts in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-emergency-access).

The results of this section are:

- The only user accounts in your subscription that have the global admin role are the dedicated global administrator accounts. Verify this with the following Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph command: 
  ```powershell
  Get-AzureADDirectoryRole | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq "Company Administrator" } | Get-AzureADDirectoryRoleMember | Ft DisplayName
  ```
- All other user accounts that manage your subscription services have admin roles assigned that are associated with their job responsibilities.

> [!Note]
> See [Connect to Office 365 PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/powershell/connect-to-office-365-powershell) for instructions on installing the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module and signing in.

## Set up on-demand administrators

*This is optional and applies only to the E5 version of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

In this section, you'll set up Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to reduce the amount of time that your administrator accounts are vulnerable to attack by malicious users. PIM provides on-demand, just-in-time assignment of the administrator roles when needed.  

Instead of your administrator accounts being permanent admins, they become eligible admins. The administrator role is inactive until someone needs it. You'll then complete an activation process to add the administrator role to the administrator account for a specific amount of time. When the time expires, PIM removes the administrator role from the administrator account.

PIM is available with Azure Active Directory Premium P2, which is included with Microsoft 365 E5. Alternately, you can purchase individual Azure Active Directory Premium P2 licenses for your administrator accounts.

To enable Azure PIM for your Azure AD tenant and administrator accounts, see the [steps to configure PIM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure).

To develop a comprehensive roadmap to secure privileged access against cyber attackers, see [Securing privileged access for hybrid and cloud deployments in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/admin-roles-best-practices).

As an interim checkpoint, you can see the [exit criteria](identity-exit-criteria.md#crit-identity-pim) for this section.

## Privileged access management

Privileged access management is enabled by configuring policies that specify just-in-time access for task-based activities in your Office 365 tenant. It can help protect your organization from breaches that may use existing privileged administrator accounts with standing access to sensitive data or access to critical configuration settings. For example, you could configure a privileged access management policy that requires explicit approval to access and change organization mailbox settings in your Office 365 tenant.

In this step, you'll enable privileged access management in your Office 365 tenant and configure privileged access policies that provide additional security for task-based access to Office 365 data and configuration settings for your organization. There are three basic steps to get started with privileged access in your Office 365 organization:

- Creating an approver's group
- Enabling privileged access
- Creating approval policies

One configured, privileged access management will enable your organization to operate with zero standing privileges and provide a layer of defense against vulnerabilities arising because of such standing administrative access. Privileged access requires approvals for executing any task that has an associated approval policy defined. Users needing to execute tasks included in the an approval policy must request and be granted access approval in order to have permissions necessary to execute tasks defined in the policy.

To enable Office 365 privileged access management, see the [Configure privileged access management in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/privileged-access-management-configuration) topic.

For more information, see the [Privileged access management in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/privileged-access-management-overview) topic.
