# Step 1: Prepare your network for Microsoft 365

*This step is required and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

In Step 1, you must:

- Evaluate and adjust network bandwidth for internal links and Internet connections to account for traffic to Microsoft 365 Enterprise cloud services.
- Align your network with an [Office 365 reference architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/office-365-network-connectivity-principles#BKMK_P2).
- Plan the changes, pilot them, and then test whether the changes fit your bandwidth and traffic latency requirements.

For information and recommendations about using ExpressRoute with Office 365 and the other cloud services of Microsoft 365 Enterprise, see [Azure ExpressRoute for Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/azure-expressroute).

As an interim checkpoint, you can see the [exit criteria](networking-exit-criteria.md#crit-networking-step1) corresponding to this step.
