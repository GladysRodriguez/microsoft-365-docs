## Hunt with Microsoft Threat Protection

[Turn on Microsoft Threat Protection](mtp-enable.md) to get the advanced hunting query interface directly in the Microsoft 365 security center. With [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md), you can create single queries that look into data from both Microsoft Defender ATP, covering data from onboarded devices, and Office 365 ATP, providing data from emails.
