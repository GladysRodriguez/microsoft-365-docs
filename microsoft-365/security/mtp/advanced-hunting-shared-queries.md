# Use shared queries in advanced hunting

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Threat Protection

[!INCLUDE [Prerelease information](../includes/prerelease.md)]

[Advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) queries can be shared among users in the same organization. You can also find queries shared publicly on GitHub. These queries let you quickly pursue specific threat hunting scenarios without having to write queries from scratch.

## Access queries in the GitHub repository  
Microsoft security researchers regularly share advanced hunting queries in a [designated public repository on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/MTP-AHQ). This repository is open to contributions. To contribute, [join GitHub for free](https://github.com/).

>[!tip]
>Microsoft security researchers also provide advanced hunting queries that you can use to locate activities and indicators associated with emerging threats. These queries are provided as part of the [threat analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/threat-analytics) reports in Microsoft Defender Security Center.
