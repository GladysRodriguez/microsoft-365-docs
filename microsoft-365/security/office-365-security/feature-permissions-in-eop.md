# Feature permissions in EOP

The permissions required to perform tasks to manage Exchange Online Protection (EOP) vary depending on the feature you are managing.

To set up EOP, you must be an Office 365 Global Admin, or an Exchange Company Administrator (the Organization Management role group).

## Exchange Online Protection permissions

To find out what permissions you need to manage EOP features, see the following table. If a feature lists more than one role group, you only need to be assigned one of the role groups to use the feature.
